# Nest Defense Strategy (WIP)

Nest Defense is an alliance event and, similar to the [Lure Trap](lure-trap.md) event, is pretty-much all about damage output. The tactics used to maximise our effectiveness are different to the Lure Trap event though, so if you want to know how to do it "right" (or at least "better"), read on...

By the way, Nest Defense is the one with the yellow circles and is not to be confused with Predator Invasion, which is the one where spiders invade your nest. The way I remember which is which is in Predator *Invasion*, my nest gets *invaded*, and this is the other one ;)

The basic idea is that once the event is started, yellow circles will appear on the map in and near our alliance territory, and a 5 minute countdown will start. At the end of the 5 minutes, an enemy will appear in all of the circles except for one. That last empty circle is where the "boss" at the end of each stage will appear. We clear a stage by firstly killing all of the smaller bugs, immediately after which a boss will appear in its own circle, then we kill that too. As soon as the boss is dead, the next stage immediately begins. 

This keeps going for 25 minutes - kill the small bugs, kill the boss, rinse, repeat. Our aim is to kill as many bosses as possible so that we can all claim the bigger and better rewards for doing so. Simple, right?

But how can we maximise our chances of being able to reach those higher levels?

I tend to break down events into phases that I can discuss, and I'll do that again here.

Before the event starts (or during the first five minutes after it has started but before the bugs appear), it is helpful to work out who is online that the strongest march - their job during Phase 1 is going to be the `Assassin` (this is typically the player with the strongest march who can one-shot kill the Boss for the first 6+ levels). Everyone else will be `Crowd Control`. 

To make things easier to talk about below, here's some terminology I'll use:

* _**Minions**_ - The small enemies that appear at the start of each phase.
* _**Boss**_ - The big enemy that appears after all _**Minions**_ are dead.
* `Assassin` - the person responsible for killing the _**Boss**_ in the second part of each stage as quickly as possible in Phase 2.  
* `Crowd Control` - this is everyone else taking part - responsible for killing the _**Minions**_ (and leaving the _**Boss**_ alone) in the first part of each stage in Phase 2

## Phase 1 - the first five minutes

During this phase, immediately after the event has officially started, there are 5 minutes where no enemies have yet appeared. If we haven't yet decided who the `Assassin` is, figure out who has the strongest march (who is the hardest hitter) and who is going to be there for the whole event, and they should be chosen as the `Assassin`. Also during this phase, make sure you know where circles are. 

It doesn't matter how far the circles are from your nest - march times are fixed at 30 seconds each way, so if circles are the other side of the alliance or right next to your nest, it will still take 30 seconds to reach them, and 30 seconds to get back to your nest. Ideally you want to get a few circles on your screen at the same time - in the next phases you will just be sending out your marches as quickly as possible to kill whatever appears in the circles - so not having to scroll around is helpful.

As soon as that first five minutes is up, the first wave of _**Minions**_ will appear and Phase 2 has started...

## Phase 2 - until the `Assassin` can no longer one-shot the _**Boss**_

In the early phases the _**Minions**_ won't take much to kill - in fact it's not uncommon to send out a march and be beaten to the prize by someone else. This is not a bad thing though! Remember - our aim is to get through things as quickly as possible - the higher the stage we get to before the end, the better the rewards for everyone taking part.
