# Nest Defense Strategy (WIP)

Nest Defense is an alliance event and, similar to the [Lure Trap](lure-trap.md) event, is pretty-much all about damage output. The tactics used to maximise our effectiveness are different to the Lure Trap event though, so if you want to know how to do it "right" (or at least "better"), read on...

By the way, Nest Defense is the one with the yellow circles and is not to be confused with Predator Invasion, which is the one where spiders invade your nest. The way I remember which is which is in Predator *Invasion*, my nest gets *invaded*, and this is the other one :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

The basic idea is that once the event is started, yellow circles will appear on the map in and near our alliance territory, and a 5 minute countdown will start. At the end of the 5 minutes, an enemy will appear in all of the circles except for one. That last empty circle is where the "boss" at the end of each stage will appear. We clear a stage by firstly killing all of the smaller bugs, immediately after which a boss will appear in its own circle, then we kill that too. As soon as the boss is dead, the next stage immediately begins. 

This keeps going for 25 minutes - kill the small bugs, kill the boss, rinse, repeat. Our aim is to kill as many bosses as possible so that we can all claim the bigger and better rewards for doing so. Simple, right?

But how can we maximise our chances of being able to reach those higher levels?

I tend to break down events into phases that I can discuss, and I'll do that again here.

Before the event starts (or during the first five minutes after it has started but before the bugs appear), it is helpful to work out who is online that the strongest march - their job during Phase 1 is going to be the `Assassin` (this is typically the player with the strongest march who can one-shot kill the Boss for the first 6+ levels). Everyone else will be `Crowd Control`. 

To make things easier to talk about below, here's some terminology I'll use:

* _**Minions**_ - The small enemies that appear at the start of each phase.
* _**Boss**_ - The big enemy that appears after all _**Minions**_ are dead.
* `Assassin` - the person responsible for killing the _**Boss**_ in the second part of each stage as quickly as possible in Phase 2.  
* `Crowd Control` - this is everyone else taking part - responsible for killing the _**Minions**_ (and leaving the _**Boss**_ alone) in the first part of each stage in Phase 2

## Phase 1 - the first five minutes

During this phase, immediately after the event has officially started, there are 5 minutes where no enemies have yet appeared. If we haven't yet decided who the `Assassin` is, figure out who has the strongest march (who is the hardest hitter) and who is going to be there for the whole event, and they should be chosen as the `Assassin`. Also during this phase, make sure you know where circles are. 

It doesn't matter how far the circles are from your nest - march times are fixed at 30 seconds each way, so if circles are the other side of the alliance or right next to your nest, it will still take 30 seconds to reach them, and 30 seconds to get back to your nest. Ideally you want to get a few circles on your screen at the same time - in the next phases you will just be sending out your marches as quickly as possible to kill whatever appears in the circles - so not having to scroll around is helpful.

As soon as that first five minutes is up, the first wave of _**Minions**_ will appear and Phase 2 has started...

## Phase 2 - until the `Assassin` can no longer one-shot the _**Boss**_

In the early phases the _**Minions**_ won't take much to kill - in fact it's not uncommon to send out a march and be beaten to the prize by someone else. This is not a bad thing though! Remember - our aim is to get through things as quickly as possible - the higher the stage we get to before the end, the better the rewards for everyone taking part.

### Instructions for `Crowd Control` in Phase 2

To help us get through the first few phases as quickly as possible, leave the _**Boss**_ to the `Assassin`!

Really! I mean it! Don't attack the boss until you're told to - the `Assassin` can do it alone, and all you'll be doing is tying up one or more of your marches for a minute, which means you will be far less helpful on clearing the _**Minions**_.

Your job is to clear the _**Minions**_!

When things run smoothely, this is how it goes for `Crowd Control` members in Phase 2.

* _**Minions**_ appear. You immediately send out your marches to kill them.
* Approximately 30 seconds later, the _**Minions**_ are all dead and the _**Boss**_ appears.
* Your marches return to your nest over the next 30 seconds, and simultaneously the `Assassin` sends out their march to kill the _**Boss**_ (_please_ leave the _**Boss**_ to the `Assassin` and use your marches on the _**Minions**_ only as this will be the most efficient approach)
* Approximately 30 seconds later, your marches are all back in your nest and the `Assassin` one-shots the _**Boss**_.
* The next wave of _**Minions**_ appear. You immediately send out your marches to kill them... rinse, repeat!

Once the `Assassin` either can no longer take care of the _**Boss**_ by themself, or at a pre-agreed level, we'll move to Phase 3. Usually this is level 7 or later - and is where even the _**Minions**_ start getting much harder to kill...

### Instructions for `Assassin` in Phase 2

If you're the `Assassin`, your primary focus is to kill the _**Boss**_ as quickly and efficiently as possible until such a point where you no longer can. This is an important role, and your responsibilities are straight-forward...

The most important rule for you as the nominated `Assassin`, especially at the start, is to leave the _**Minions**_ to everyone else. Save your strongest march for the boss! While everyone else is killing the little guys in round 1, you should be finding the extra empty yellow circle where the _**Boss**_ will appear, and watch it like a hawk, ready to send out your strongest march as quickly as possible _**the instant it appears**_!

Remember, we want to minimise wasted time - so as soon as it appears you need to send as quick as possible so that as close as we can to 30 seconds later, everyone else can send out their marches for the next wave of _**Minions**_.

If you've made the mistake of sending out your march(es) to take out the small guys, you're not going to react quickly enough to kill the _**Boss**_ during the time it takes everyone's march(es) to return - so show self-restraint, and leave the small fry to your team to mop up.

If you have lots of troops and marches, then you could send out your weaker marches to kill small guys too, but bear in mind that when you send them out, they won't be back for at least 60 seconds... so if you think you'll need more than 1 march to kill the boss at, say, stage 6, then you should not send out your second strongest march on stage 5 because it won't get back in time.

If you mess up at any point, ask others to cover for you - someone else might be able to take over the `Assassin`'s duties at short-notice.

When things run smoothely, this is how it goes for the `Assassin` in Phase 2.

* _**Minions**_ appear. Everyone else in `Crowd Control` immediately send out their marches to kill them.
* Approximately 30 seconds later, the _**Minions**_ are all dead and the _**Boss**_ appears.
* You (the `Assassin`) immediately send out your strongest march to kill the _**Boss**_.
* Approximately 30 seconds later, your march one-shots the _**Boss**_, and all of the `Crowd Control` marches have returned to their nest, ready to send out again.
* The next wave of _**Minions**_ appear. Everyone else in `Crowd Control` immediately send out their marches to kill them... rinse, repeat!

Once you, the `Assassin`, either can no longer take care of the _**Boss**_ yourself, or at a pre-agreed level (if you know in advance how many _**Boss**_ phases you can solo), we'll move to Phase 3. Usually this is level 7 or later - and is where even the _**Minions**_ start getting harder to kill...

## Phase 3 - when the `Assassin` needs assistance too

If everything has gone like clockwork, we should have cleared the first 7 waves or so and have approximately 15 minutes left, and those stupid bugs are getting quite tough - tough enough that our `Assassin` needs some assistance in clearing the _**Boss**_. Chances are there will also start being _**Minions**_ that take more than one hit for people to clear.

Eventually it's going to be a case of just getting your marches out and killing everything in sight. If you're one of the stronger players, between marches take a look at which enemies have the highest amount of hit-points left, and help on those, and if they are all close to dead, and others are already en-route, then consider holding back a couple of your marches for the next boss instead.

When the clock runs out, the event is over. Hopefully this guide has helped you have a successful one, or given you some pointers for where you might improve how your alliance runs this event. Don't forget to pick up those juicy rewards! :grin:
