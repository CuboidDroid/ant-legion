# Being Effective at Lure

The Lure Trap event is all about damage output. The more damage we collectively output before the time runs out, the better we will do both individually and as an alliance.

The enemy in the trap has a number of points that increases with level. The R4/R5 starting the trap will pick a level based on how many people are online, and how many of our "big hitters" are there.

Once the trap starts, there are 3 distinct phases that are determined by the time left on the clock and the time it takes for rallies to run. These are not specifically phases in the game, but how I like to think of the event broken down logically.

## Phase 1 - 30:00 to 25:00

As soon as the event starts, we need to be creating and filling rallies. 

People with large rally sizes (1 mil +) should consider creating rallies as soon as possible, __but not with their strongest march__! (see additional information below for the reason why). 

Rallies can be spaced out a little, but the key here is to *ensure that there is always room for people to join a rally*. If there is no room in the available rallies and you haven't yet created a rally, then do so (even if your size is < 1 mil). It is important to ensure that we're always able to send out all our damage dealers we possibly can, as quickly as we can.

After this initial flurry of rallies being created, we all just sit around until the 25:00 mark, which is when the first rallies will actually march...

## Phase 2 - 25:00 to 09:00

For the next 16 minutes, every time a march returns to you, you should be ready to send it straight back out again.

If you were the host of the rally that finished, you should create a new rally so that we can keep filling them up.

If you were a participant of the rally that finished, you should look for the next rally to leave that is about 45 seconds or higher in terms of countdown (so as not to delay it - check your march times!) and that has room for your march, and join it. The idea here is that you want to re-use your strongest marches as often as possible, so always try and get into rallies that are departing soon.

Keep doing this until the clock hits 9 minutes remaining.

## Phase 3 - 09:00 to 05:30-ish

During this phase, instead of just joining an existing rally, if you are not already hosting a rally, then *please host one instead*! The reason for this is that in the last 5 minutes we need lots of available space for people to get in the last hits...

Even if your rally size is small, it's useful to have the extra rallies to work with in the last 5 minutes - so create one please :-)

The "05:30-ish" will depend on how far your nest is from the Lure Trap - or, more specifically, what your rally march time is to get to the trap (take note of this when you host your first rally). Basically, all rallies have a 5 minute delay while people join, and then the march time, and only then does it hit the trap. So if your rally takes 20 seconds to get there, if the clock is under 5:25 (assuming it will take about 5 seconds to create the rally) then you should not bother creating a rally anymore. If your march time for a rally from your nest is 45 seconds, then you should not create new rallies once the timer hits 05:50.

During the next phase we're going to *really* need those extra rallies available, so please do your bit and host a rally if you can.

## Phase 4 - 05:00 to 01:00

We're in the last stretch now, no more new rallies because there won't be enough time for them to form and march before the event timer runs out.

This is why Phase 3 is so important... in phase 4 we will all be getting all of our marches back from the rallies that were finishing up early, but we won't have the option to start new rallies or join new ones either - all we can do is fill up the rallies that already exist - so fill them up with everything you've got!

## Phase 5 - 01:00 to 00:00

Not much more we can do now apart from hope we've done enough! 

In fact, unless you're 100% certain you can get to a rally without delaying it, you should just sit back and relax now, and watch the time tick down. Unnecessarily delaying a rally might make the difference between it landing in time or being wasted effort, so please be careful!

And that's it! That's how to get through Lure Trap effectively, maximising damage for yourself and the alliance. Read on for a few more tips and advice if you're interested in learning more.

## Tips, Tricks and Advice

- *Do not delay rallies*. Remember, the goal is to maximise our damage within a limited time available. Any delays to rallies starting will, at best, reduce our damage output and, at worst, will risk the rally not making it to the trap before time runs out.
- *Don't send movers*.  Only send attacking troops (Melee, Ranged, Haste) to maximise our damage output. While the number of participants in a rally is not limited to 6 like they are for predator nests, they waste of slots for troops that could be doing much more damage. A good tip here if you struggle with this is to sacrifice one march and send your movers to the alliance farm or a garrison position for the duration of the event.
- The time it takes for a rally to march from a nest to the trap matters. Ideally our players who are usually online and have large rally sizes should be nearest the trap. If you're seldom online for this event, or have small rally size, *please consider moving* to make room for players who are usually there and/or have larger rally sizes.
- To increase your rally size, *keep upgrading your Rally Ground building* in your nest.
- If you have spare, and/or want to up your personal damage output / points, consider using an ATK +X% boost item.

## Additional Information

*Don't host with your strongest march* - The reason you should not host a rally with your strongest march is because then it is going to be tied up for that full 5 minutes every time. During the event, you will want to be able to join rallies that have the lowest time remaining with enough room for your strongest march - that way you can use your strongest troops more often than once every 5 minutes, and thereby maximise your damage output overall. In fact, you should really only host with your weakest march if possible, or close to it, and always send your strongest ants on other people's marches instead.
